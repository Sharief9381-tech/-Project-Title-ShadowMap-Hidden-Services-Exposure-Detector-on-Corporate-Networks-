## 🚀 Features

- Active & Passive Network Scanning
- Service Fingerprinting (via Nmap, Shodan API, etc.)
- Anomaly Detection using baseline comparison or ML (optional)
- Reports exposed services with metadata
- Pluggable detection modules

## 📦 Installation

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ShadowMap.git
cd ShadowMap
pip install -r requirements.txt
